This repo has reduction & mapping code for Keck/NIRSPEC observations of H3+ at Jupiter. 

The reccomended path when using them is:
(1) Keck Data Reduction Pipeline
(2) h3ppy Test Fitting Routines
(3) h3ppy Mass Fitting Routines
(4) Matching Slit Positions

Other files in the repo (inner and outer auroral oval coordinates, Io and Europa footprints, and the H3+ dark ribbon from Stallard+) are for mapping onto the planet for comparison. 
The Chapman line of sight correction is adapted from Smith & Smith 1972 (https://doi.org/10.1029/JA077i019p03592) and is used when matching derived temperatures & densities with lats & longs in Matching Slit Positions.

There is more information in each file about what information is needed to run them & how exactly to do so.
